            <p>Hello! My name is Vanessa. I am from Brazil. I am married, and we have two daughters. I enjoy to travel and spend time with my family.</p>  

            <p>We are members of the Church. We had the opportunity to serve missions. I served in Brazil-Porto Alegre North and my husband served in Brazil-João Pessoa. 
            The gospel is a blessing in our lives. Currently, I am serving as a first counselor in the Relief Society in my ward and my husband is serving as a stake president.</p>
            
            <p>I completed my degree in Physics in December 2012. I took a break from my academic and professional career to focus on raising my family.</p>

            <p>Now I am taking advantage of this opportunity to study at my own pace, remote and to study two challenging subjects for me: Programming and English. 
            This will help me develop skills I will need to continue my studies in Physics in the future and will open new professional opportunities.</p>
